## Short Bio

I am an Applied Scientist at [Amazon Q Business Automate Team](https://aws.amazon.com/q/business/) working on generative AI powered enterprise automation service that provides the fastest and easiest way to build and maintain workflow automations. I received my PhD in Machine Learning from Georgia Institute of Technology, where I was fortunately advised by Prof. [Justin Romberg](https://ece.gatech.edu/directory/justin-romberg) and Prof. [Ashwin Pananjady](https://sites.gatech.edu/ashwin-pananjady/) on single- and multi-agent RL. Before that, I got my master's degree in Applied Mathematics from Columbia University and bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from Wuhan University.
