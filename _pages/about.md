## Short Bio

I am an Applied Scientist at [Amazon Q Business Automate Team](https://aws.amazon.com/q/business/) working on generative AI powered enterprise automation service that provides the fastest and easiest way to build and maintain workflow automations. I received my PhD in Machine Learning from Georgia Institute of Technology, where I was fortunately advised by Prof. [Justin Romberg](https://ece.gatech.edu/directory/justin-romberg) and Prof. [Ashwin Pananjady](https://sites.gatech.edu/ashwin-pananjady/). Before that, I got my master's degree in Applied Mathematics from Columbia University and bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from Wuhan University.

My PhD research mainly focuses on single- and multi-agent RL. The overall goal of my research is to enhance the theoretical understanding of RL, and to design efficient algorithms for large-scale problems arise from machine-learning and decision-making applications. I have published and presented several papers in top tier venues in machine learning, optimization and control.
