I am an Applied Scientist at [Amazon Q Business Automate Team](https://aws.amazon.com/q/business/). I am particularly interested in AI Agents, Large Multimodal Models and Reinforcement Learning. I received my PhD in Machine Learning from Georgia Institute of Technology, where I was fortunately advised by Prof. [Justin Romberg](https://ece.gatech.edu/directory/justin-romberg) and Prof. [Ashwin Pananjady](https://sites.gatech.edu/ashwin-pananjady/). Before that, I got my master's degree in Applied Mathematics from Columbia University.
